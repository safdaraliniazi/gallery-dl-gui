# Browser Preview Feature Guide

## Overview
The Gallery-DL GUI includes a web preview feature that allows you to view supported websites directly within the application. However, this feature has specific requirements.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What Works Now
- **Site Selection**: Click on any website in the About tab to select it
- **External Browser**: Double-click any website to open it in your default browser
- **Site Information**: View all 300+ supported sites with categories and descriptions
- **Fallback Display**: Informative message about browser preview availability

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Browser Preview Compatibility

#### Python Version Requirements
- **CEF Browser Preview**: Requires Python 3.8-3.9 (Windows)
- **Current Version**: Check with `python --version`
- **Supported Versions**: CEF Python v66.1 supports Python 3.8 and 3.9 on Windows

#### Why Newer Python Versions Aren't Supported Yet
CEF Python (Chrome Embedded Framework for Python) needs to compile native binaries for each Python version. CEF Python v66.1 was released with support for Python 3.8-3.9. Newer Python versions require updated CEF Python releases with compatible binaries.

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Current Features
The application is fully functional without browser preview:
- Browse all 300+ supported websites
- Double-click to open sites in your default browser
- Use the download functionality normally
- All other features work perfectly

### Option 2: Enable Browser Preview (For Advanced Users)
If you specifically need in-app browser preview:

1. **Install Python 3.9**:
   ```bash
   # Download Python 3.9 from python.org
   # Or use package manager like winget
   winget install Python.Python.3.9
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment with Python 3.9**:
   ```bash
   # Use Python 3.9 to create environment
   py -3.9 -m venv gdlgui_env
   
   # Activate environment
   gdlgui_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # or
   source gdlgui_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install gallery-dl cefpython3
   ```

4. **Run Application**:
   ```bash
   python gallery_dl_gui.py
   ```

## Feature Timeline

### Current Features ‚úÖ
- Complete MVC architecture
- Advanced download functionality
- 300+ sites database
- Professional UI design
- Site categorization and search
- External browser integration

### Browser Preview Roadmap üîÑ
- **Short-term**: Fallback display with helpful information (‚úÖ Complete)
- **Medium-term**: CEF Python compatibility when Python 3.13 support is released
- **Alternative**: Consider WebView2 for Windows-specific browser integration

## Troubleshooting

### "CEF Python doesn't support Python 3.13 yet"
This is expected and normal. The application works perfectly without browser preview.

### "CEF Python not installed"
Only relevant if using Python 3.12 or earlier. Install with: `pip install cefpython3`

### Browser Preview Shows Fallback Message
This indicates CEF Python is either:
- Not compatible with your Python version (most likely)
- Not installed
- Failed to initialize

## Development Notes

The application is designed with progressive enhancement:
- **Core functionality**: Works on all Python versions
- **Enhanced features**: Available when dependencies support it
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Clear information when features aren't available

This ensures the best possible experience regardless of your Python version while keeping the door open for enhanced features when they become available.
